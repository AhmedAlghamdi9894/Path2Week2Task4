# Path2Week2Task4
This repository includes the files for the 4th task in the robotics path. the folder contains an image of the circuit, a vidoe of the proteus simulation, proteus project file and an arduino .ino file. (ino files need to get compiled to get the hex file that gets inputed into the simulation).
